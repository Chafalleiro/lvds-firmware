### T.VST(2|5)9.031

This is similar board. I found firms for T.VST59.031, it is not matched to _LA.MV9.P V59_'s firms, why...?
[http://kythuatphancung.vn/diendan/index.php?/topic/33828-firmware-board-tv-lcd-tvst59031-chip-tsumv59xu-z1-update-20141023/]

### How to select .bin file

1. If the directory name contains the model number of the panel, that's exactly what.
2. Else, first, check the panel spec: [LVDS Input Voltage(3.3V/5V/12V)], [LVDS channels(1ch/2ch)], [LVDS bandwidth(6bit/8bit)], [Resolution(pixel)], using like [panelook.com](http://www.panelook.com/).
3. Open _5key_ or _7key_ directory(select your own), Search directories that _Resolution_ is matched.
4. Next, search LVDS interface is matched; the part of directory name, as regexp, has _(SI|DO)(6|8)(L|T)?_ string.
    - SI: single; _1ch_
    - DO: double; _2ch_
    - 6/8: _6bit_ or _8bit_ interface
    - L/T: (maybe) logic level; _LVDS_ or _TTL_ (; TTL is older interface, these panel is almost unavailable.)
    - \*For example, [LQ170M1LA4B](http://www.panelook.com/modeldetail.php?id=10195) is _LVDS(2ch,6bit,3.3V)_, resolution is _1920x1200_. So the directory name should contains _DO6L_ and _1920x1200_.
5. Then, select voltage, directory name contains _3V_ for 3.3V, _5V_ for 5V, _12V_ for 12V,
   and you should change jumper on the controller board, see documents.
6. Finally, you found more than one directory, check the model number in the directory name, compare to your panel, then select the one more similar to your panel.
    - \*For example about _LQ170M1LA4B_, we found some directories in 7key. This panel is 17inch, for _B170UW01V0_ is maybe better choice.

	
### VS.T5965.81

Found at this card, it comes with an Raphael 840 tuner. Thanks to the seller for the permision to share the firmware files.

[https://www.ebay.com/itm/V29-Universal-LCD-Controller-Board-TV-Motherboard-Support-7-55-inch-LVDS-Screen/183190128496?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649]

Don't know the code for the service menu yet.

### Just the same steps described above. The filename is VST29XX_BOOT.bin in this case it's size is 741.609 bytes.

### MEMO

essential quotes

> the board (on picture) have new updated TV tuner with R840 chip, so it use new firmware (software package must have in name "R840" ), if is used firmware for old type of board, then TV tuner not works at all. With new firmware for R840, TV works surprisingly clean and nice, with analog channels of cable network.

<!-- -->

> It looks like older board is made typically for 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratio screens.
> There is not firmware support for other laptop's typical 16:10 ratio screens (ex. no support for 1280x800) , this resolution is supported in another firmware pack added above.
> However, I was able to find firmwares for 16:10 screens, unfortunate remote control was not working with them :( .

<!-- -->

> Firmwares are described as 7 key keyboards but it works also with 5 key keyboard.
You can change connected keyboard type, 7 or 5 keys, in "service menu".

<!-- -->

> Programming is very simple, we must choose proper .bin file and copy it to pendrive at root directory, plug pendrive into USB, then plug power cord, status LED will made some flashes and software upgrade is done.

<!-- -->

> Attention:  Sometimes, when playing with firmwares, if there be power cut/brake and flash will not finish programming, than the board become dead.
> To repair/fix the board, need to be reprogrammed SPI flash chip (small 8 leg chip) in any external SPI programmer.
To do that, we must unsolder flash chip from board, put it into programmer and program the  .bin file what is placed at end of this page. 
> After program, resolder chip in his place at board, the controller will become live, so is possible to start programming again. 

_.bin file what is placed at end of this page._ is _~/TSUMV(2|5)9/repair/\*\*.bin_.

### panelook.com search support plugin for greasemonkey

[panelook.com;_search_controller_board_firmware.user.js](https://github.com/a-c-t-i-n-i-u-m/lvds-firmware/tree/master/test/panelook.com;_search_controller_board_firmware.user.js) is the user-script for searching panels at [panelook.com](http://www.panelook.com).  
When the result page, click 'Search Firmware' button, then shows firmware that (maybe) matching to that panel. 
When you change election form, result will be filtered by board type(TSUMV29/TSUMV59). 
When you click 'Aliexpress Search', for each panel, open aliexpress's search result page.  
When the detail page for each panel, this script will insert search result of firmware to page.

### shop links

- [aliexpress V59 board](http://www.aliexpress.com/af/v59.html?ltype=wholesale&SearchText=v59): US $13.50~
- [banggood.com V59 board](http://www.banggood.com/search/v59.html): US $13.21~
- [ebay.com V59 board](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Consumer-Electronics-/293/v59): US $17.69~

You'll found some 5 or 7 key keypad for these boards at the same time, or searching.

LVDS cable (connect LCD to board) is available. check your panel connection interface.
Generally there is 14pin/20pin/30pin/40pin, and LVDS signal interface (1ch/2ch, 6bit/8bit), you should select the cable match with your lcd pane.

You can find cables by searching the keyword 'LVDS cable', but the item for specific pane is useful and secure.
search by panel model name, if available, you'll find these cables.

In the case of panel backlight is CCFL, maybe you have to buy CCFL driving _inverter_ module.
Fortunately, also you can find the cheap module for this usage.
Check the backlight conposition of your panel, generally CCFL is 1ch/2ch.
for example, [on aliexpress it is available from US $2.30 with cable for connect to controller board](http://www.aliexpress.com/af/ccfl-inverter-lcd.html?ltype=wholesale).

If you worried about wrong buying or setup, there is the package of these accessories and the board(the firmware for specific panel was burned).


### researching...

I found similar boards, called _T.VST29.03_ and _T.VST59.03_ or _T.VST59.031_.
It is similar looks, and maybe has a USB update features.
[document for T.VST59.03 is available](http://wenku.baidu.com/view/a2de0eb51ed9ad51f11df2b9.html), almost same as _LA.MV9.P V59_.
how is it?
